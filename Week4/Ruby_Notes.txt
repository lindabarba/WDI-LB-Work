INTRO:
double-quotes more conventional
snake_case
way more methods in Ruby than JS
? how many methods is the average programmer familiar with?
encapsulation - OOP
	Unlike JavaScript, in Ruby, every "property" on an object is a method, it never contains data.
	Don't misunderstand, objects contain data, it's just that the data needs to be set and retrieved using method calls.
"=" is actually a method, this is not "assign"
everything in Ruby is truthy except "false" and "nil" because all things are objects and objects are truthy
variable identifiers:
_local_variable
@instance_var

[a-z] or _ - Local variable
$ - Global variable
@ - Instance variable
@@ - Class variable
[A-Z] - A constant (class/module/global)

the way we name variables determines scope

convention is to all caps constants

CONTROL FLOW
three main types:
"The execution sequence of instructions in a program determined at run time with the use of control structures."

Everything in Ruby is considered to be truthy except for ________ and ________.
nil & false
-
As compared to JS, there are a couple of values that have different truthiness. What are they?
0 and ""

`<=>` in action:
> 5 <=> 10
=> -1
> 10 <=> 5
=> 1
> 5 <=> 5
=> 0

correct = true
puts "Congrats!" if correct == true
# this is shorter:
# puts "Congrats!" if correct

When using a while or until loop, we must be careful not put the program's execution into an __________ loop.
infinite
How do we avoid the above scenario?
include condition to exit

In your own words, how would you describe Control Flow?


The three primary types of control flow are:
1) Sequence
2) ___________ Branching (if & unless)
3) ___________ Looping (while & until)

Why might you decide to use the modified version of the while/until loop, where the condition test is put at the end of the code block?
If you want code to run once

Section 2 Exercise 1:

print "Enter a, b, or c: "
choice = gets.chomp
if choice == "a"
  puts "a is for apple"
elsif choice == "b"
  puts "b is for banana"
elsif choice == "c"
  puts "c is for cantaloupe"
else
  puts "you're a rebel"
end

Section 2 Exercise 2:

Julia's code:
choice = ""
until choice == "no more fruit"
  print "Enter a, b or c: "
  choice = gets.chomp
  if choice == "a"
    puts "a is for apple"
  elsif choice == "b"
    puts "b is for banana"
  elsif choice == "c"
    puts "c is for cantaloupe"
  else
    puts "you're a rebel"
  end
end

ARRAYS, HASHED, & BLOCKS

evens = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# What is evens.count?
evens.count do |number|
  if number % 2 == 0
    puts "#{number}"
  else
    puts "The number #{number} is odd."
  end
end
 - this will iterate over the number 8 not the array because evens.count will return 8
