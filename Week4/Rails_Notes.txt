rake routes are now rails routes

Models: (from the Rails docs): "A model represents the information (data)^aka resource^ of the application and the rules to manipulate and interact with that data. In the case of Rails, models are primarily used for managing the rules of interaction with a corresponding database table. In most cases, one table in your database will correspond to one model in your application. The bulk of your application's business logic will be concentrated in the models."

Views - templates serverd to client based on request (????)

Controller - handles the request & response, the 'glue'

Explain the use case of Rails. - lightweight, efficient, for CRUD

Where does a Rails application execute? - server (program logic is on server-side)

What are the responsibilities of models? - interfacing with DB & controller

What are the responsibilities of views? - render HTML for client

What are the responsibilities of contollers? - handle requests & response, glue between controller & model

ruby code:
<% - called clown hats, squids or ruby diamonds
<%= - called squid with ink

table for every model
schema is only place that you can find attributes of model

don't ever edit schema directly - change via migrate

# could also use '/beans' but below is per style guide


option + cmd + . - will close tag in Sublime

root route: 

root to: 'beans#index'
OR root 'beans#index'
OR root "beans#index"
