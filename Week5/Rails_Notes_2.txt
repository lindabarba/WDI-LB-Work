ACTIVERECORD
ActiveRecord - is the layer of the Rails framework dedicated to working with data
		implements the Model in Model-View-Controller app architecture
		is known as an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper) which allows to work w/data in code via objects & methods (OOP)

Models
1:1 mapping to model and table in database

When we create a model class, you will see that no attributes are defined in the model class. The attributes are defined in the database table's schema.

We use models primarily to:

Inform ActiveRecord of the relationships with other models (as shown in the previous diagram).
Define optional data validations.
Add custom behavior, for example, provide a full_name method.


order of creation of migration matters - may need data/attributes from parent models

rails db:drop - totall remove existing database

**
ok to edit migration files IF they have not been run
**

???? is there a command line util to "copy" a migration to make a template of migration?

persistence - process of saving in-memory data to more perm storage like db

Models have a one-to-one mapping with __________ in the database.

A database's schema should only be modified using __________.

If we have a model class called LineItem, what will the table be named?

As our application evolves over time, we use __________ to modify our database's schema.

What benefit does an ORM provide to developers?

CRUD Using ActiveRecord

In the previous lesson we learned how to create data using our model class.
One way is with the __________ + __________ methods.
	new save
The other way is with the __________ method.
	create
The new and create methods are called on the __________.
	Model
The save method is called on an __________.
	
In this lesson, we just created several Person models in the database using the __________ command in Terminal.
	db:seed
What's the name of the table holding our Person objects?
	People

the all method returns an ActiveRecord Relation, which is a way of Rails holding on to a query until it's necessary to hit the database

If we know the id(s) of our model(s), we should use the ________ method to retrieve data because...?
	find - most performant

Some AR methods return an ActiveRecord Relation, why is this advantageous to the developer?
	flexibility, holds in memory temporarily until ready to hit DB, can modify query
	chain "composition"


diff bw 'delete' & 'destroy' - destroy will run callbacks, delete does not - customary to always use destroy

Describe two ways to update a model instance?
	run method on attribute & save or update_attributes

What's the difference between what you get back when querying with where and find_by?
	where gives you all, find_by the first instance

How do you permanently remove a model from the database?
	destroy

How do we determine the number of models (rows) in a table or query?
	Model.count - count method

--------
def index
  random = params[:random].exists?

"rails query string"
2 attributes
votes - custom action
form_for - new form template
