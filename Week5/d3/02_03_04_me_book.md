## MeBook

You've now seen controllers, views and models in Rails. You've seen how to define RESTful routes and how to define associations between models. Let's apply this knowledge by building a simple application. I have given you designs and user stories. It is your task to implement these designs in Rails.

### Task Details

Create a brand new Rails application that meets the requirements below. This application should be located in a GitHub repository with a `README` containing instructions for how to get this running locally.

### The Pitch

Social media is so overrated. I much prefer anti-social media. This is where MeBook comes into play.
MeBook is an anti-social media platform where a user can create a profile and make posts that **ONLY** they can see. Who needs friends?!?!?!?

### Design Specs

This application consists of two pages:
  * an index page
  * edit/create profile page

#### Index Page

The user stories and design for the index page are below.

As a user I would like...

* To be able to type in a new post
* Once I'm done entering a post I would like to make the post appear in my feed by clicking the "POST" button
* I would like to see all of my posts with the most recent posts appearing on top
* I would like the month, day and year at which I made the post to automatically appear under my post
* I would like the ability to scroll down to see older posts (the Navigation Bar should be fixed and always visible)
* I should not be able to make a post until I have entered in my profile information. This should be communicated to me by the button being grayed out and un-clickable.

#### Edit Profile Page

The user stories and design for the edit profile page are below.

As a user I would like...

* Enter my first and last name
* Upload a picture of me
* Have this data be saved and the UI updated accordingly when I click "Done"

![edit_page](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17VZ28PgBz0nwRIUXGG74Kis7sU-v6TNhCzAHK_BDLyc/pub?w=765&h=503)

#### Additional Specs

* Use [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) for file uploading
* Use [Bootstap](http://getbootstrap.com/)<sup>1</sup> for common UI elments (input fields, buttons, etc.)
<sup>1</sup>If you loathe Bootstrap feel free to use another CSS library
* This needs to be responsive

#### Bonus: Possible Extensions

* Deploy your application to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5)
* Implement custom styling in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* Add authentication to this application. This involves:
  - creating a login and sign-up view
  - securely storing a user's password
  - validating a user's password
