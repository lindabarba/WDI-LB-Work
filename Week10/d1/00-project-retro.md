## Project Retrospective

Gather with your groups and perform a retrospective. We will use a 
simplified version of the [Thinking Hats Retro][thinking-hats], where we
collaborate to discuss the course of the project and our own work on it.

The categories are, in order:

1. **FACTS** (Black Hat)
2. **POSITIVE POINTS** (Green Hat)
3. **NEGATIVE POINTS** (Red Hat)
4. RE/**SOLUTIONS** (Blue Hat)

### [The Prime Directive][prime-directive]

> ***Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe

> time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the 
> situation at hand.***

This is the most important (and maybe the only) rule for retros. The
purpose of the retro is to discover ways to possibly *do better next time*. This is not a place for blame, judgement, or criticism of 
oneself or one's teammates: it's a place to **identify what went well** 
and **what could have gone better**, and then to discuss how to 
ensure that the successes are repeated, and the failures are not.

### Process

Working with your project groups, perform the Simplified
Thinking Hats Retro. Each team will need:

- 1 *writer* with the markers: Black, Green, Red and Blue, and a towel…
- 1 *recorder* with a phone and laptop.

Other than these two, no one on the team should have anything out or 
open.

After this, follow the steps for each section of the retro:

1.  **Black Hat**: the group begins by collecting as many
    ***facts*** about the sprint as possible. This is usually the
    hardest part of the retro, since you have to answer: 

    > What happenned during the sprint?

    … without reference to emotions, qualitative or valuative 
    statements, judgements, comparisons, or even *why*'s.

    The purpose of this part is to simply jog everyone's memory about
    the sprint, and to focus the retro. It should take no longer than 8
    minutes (maximum!).

    Here are some examples of bad or unacceptable facts, and better ways
    to state them:

    > Bad: *we struggled with using jQuery*   
    > Good: *we used jquery to interact with the DOM*   
    > 
    > Bad: *we did not meet our goal of implementing all user stories*   
    > Good: (1) *we completed all 12 user stories*, 
    >       (2) *our goal was to complete all 12 user stories*   
    > 
    > Bad: *Jim didn't pull his weight* (especially bad, since it 
    >      breaks the Prime Directive!)   
    > Good: (1) *the team averaged 3 tickets per member*,
    >       (2) (Jim should offer:) *I did not close any tickets…*   

    All of the facts are written in Black (along with the neutral
    emotions). They are not erased for the rest of the retro! From here 
    on, every part needs to reference some *fact* that was listed in 
    this section of the retro.
2.  **Green Hat**: the group should now work together to go back over
    the facts, and offer up positive outcomes or events from the sprint.
    These should be phrased as answers to the question:

    > What went well, or what did you do that was successful, during the
    > sprint.

    These "positive points" should help set the tone for the retro, and
    remind everyone to critically identify "wins." Positive points 
    should be written in Green, and *must reference a fact*. This 
    section should take no more than 5 minutes.
3.  **Red Hat**: the group should now work together to go back over
    the facts, and find things about the sprint that were "negative."
    These should be phrased as answers to the questions:

    > What went wrong during the sprint?   
    > What could have gone better?   
    > What "pain points" or "bottlenecks" were encountered?   
    
    … and finally:

    > What obstacles, or "blockers," kept the team or its members from
    > reaching their goals?

    Remember always: **[the Prime Directive](#the-prime-directive)**! 
    At the same time however, don't let the urge to "be constructive" 
    lead you to begin proposing solutions or dismissing criticisms that 
    are raised. Just record them! Save the judgements for the next 
    section!

    Negative points should be written in Red, and *must reference a 
    fact*. This section should take no more than 5 minutes.
4.  **Blue Hat**: this section of the retro takes place in two parts,

    - first, identifying positive and negative priorities, and…
    - next, proposing resolutions and solutions.

    Once the recorder has photographed all of the points from the retro
    so far (Black, Red and Green), pick a subset of positives and
    negatives to work with: usually at least **one positive** and
    **two negatives**, but no more than three of either.
    
    These are the
    priorities for the team, or the most important of the points to
    come out of the retro. *Erase all of the facts, and the positive
    and negative points that are not priorities.*

    Work first with the positive point(s): write ***resolutions*** for
    each, identifying what the team can do to continue to hit these
    points and institute them in their sprints. For example:

    > In order to ensure the continued support we've found on Slack
    > between team members, we resolve to create a new channel
    > `#support` specifically for asking questions of the team.

    Finally, go through the negative points, and offer concrete
    suggestions, rules or new processes to avoid having these problems
    in the future. For example:

    > The team had problems knowing/understanding the application's flow.
    > A possible solution may be to diagram the overall application flow
    > and ensure that wireframes are completed for screen - before coding
    > begins.

**And that's that!** Congratulations on finishing your group project retro!

### Class Resolutions and Solutions

##### We resolve to:

- In order to ensure great stand-ups, we resolve to:
  - hold supportive stand-ups with good attendance,
  - talk more about how we fixed our problems when we do stand-ups.

##### We plan to fix the following problems:

- In order to avoid jumping ahead before working out basic functionality,
  we plan to prioritize and organize user stories in Trello.
- In order to not lose time following the wrong approach, we plan to 
  keep the initial idea (MVP) simple, and to expand on that.
- In order to avoid working with a poor data model, we plan to better 
  research our domain problem.
- In order to minimize merge conflicts, we plan to make smaller, more frequent commits, merge into master, and have the entire team pull ASAP.
